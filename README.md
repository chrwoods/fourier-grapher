A grapher built in C++ that converts vector images into an animation that uses a fourier transform to draw it using many circles.

Currently this program uses temporary test data to graph, since writing a program to parse vector images into usable data is a whole other project unto itself. However, the client and math behind the fourier transformation is fully functional! It contains a bunch of options, allowing the user to control the depth (number of circles), speed and scale of the animation, plus the ability to change the colors of the background, the circles, the lines that revolve inside the circle to hold the next, and the overall line that the rotation builds. There are also buttons to reset the time, and to clear the graph.

The math behind this is somewhat complex, but I can give a quick run-down. First, it takes a vector image as a large set of points, which is currently 40 arbitrary points in a line. It then plots each point as a complex number, with the x representing the real, and the y representing the imaginary component. It then completes a Discrete Fourier Transform on this dataset, which finds waves with increasing frequency that, added together, make the original dataset. Namely, it will make as many waves as there are datapoints, so in our case we will make 40 waves, from a frequency of one wave over an interval from 0 to 2 * pi, to forty waves over that same interval. From this wave we are able to calculate our amplitude and phase shift, which we use to plot our circles. We plot our first circle in the center-ish of the screen, with the radius represented by our amplitude, and the line in the center begins at an angle determined by the phase shift. The position in the circle that our line points to determines where the center of the next circle is placed. This system of graphing, with circles hinged on other circles, is epicycles. Once these circles all make the interval from 0 to 2 pi, the cycle repeats, and the original graph should be recreated. This regraphs our test data in this example, however I also show the points in-between for the sake of clarity, so it ends up looking like a bunch of loops, which is more ideal for showing the entire epicycle path.

Building this is done by simply calling 'make', however these graphics libraries do have to be installed first. I'm being a little overkill with the packages, but I installed so many to attempt to get graphics libraries to work, I'm not 100% sure which are necessary and which are optional, but I'm almost certain that calling "sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev mesa-common-dev" will install OpenGL and GLFW3, which are the bindings I used for my graphics library, Dear ImGui, which is self-contained in this package. If this doesn't work, try replacing 'libglfw3-dev with libglfw-dev". If that doesn't work, I have no idea what to tell you, I personally installed 100+ packages to get graphics working.

Once the building is done, just call ./fourier_grapher, and you should be good to go!

More to come in the future, thanks to github.com/ocornut for having ImGui ready to use, and thanks to me for spending way too much time piecing together how to use ImGui from its meager documentation.
