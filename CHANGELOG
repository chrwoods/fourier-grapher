04/22/2019 - began project, talked to math professor about how to go about using Fourier transforms, and started writing fourier.cpp to hold the math

04/23/2019 - began leaning how to use Dear ImGui, the graphics library I'm using

04/26/2019 - consulted with professor again, found error in my conversion from complex to cartesian from a misuse of Euler's formula

04/28/2019 - tried using base GLFW instead of ImGui to draw, ran into a lot of trouble through the use of VBO plus matrix projection

04/29/2019 - finished graphics to graph the fourier transformed data, added sliders to control depth, scale, and time, added color wheels for all four aspects (background, epicycle, line, graph). added get_data_from_file function in read_data.cpp, and added test data .txt files in data/ directory.
